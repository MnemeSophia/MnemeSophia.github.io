  <h1>Sophie's Homepage</h1>
  <p>Hi! I'm Sophie! This is my personal website! Pretty nifty, huh?</p>
  <h2>About Sophie, the Coolest Person</h2>
  <p>I have lots of hobbies! I like ballroom dance, classic literature, poetry, and I think languages are pretty nifty! I like to crochet, cook, and I'm learning how to make wine! I play videogames and run a tabletop game in the library on Saturday mornings, and at the university on Wednesday nights!</p>
  <p>People ask me what I look like, so here's the best I can do: I'm 5'2" and kinda small. I have light brown hair, brown eyes, and a fair complexion. I'm not a huge fan of denim and I hate tight leggings, so I wear skirts and dresses when I can.</p>
  <h2>Sophie's Favorite Things</h2>

    Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens<br>

<h2>Roleplaying with Sophie</h2>
<p>Roleplay is my main creative writing outlet, and probably how you found me, isn't it? Uh huh, thought so!</p>
<p>I don't care much about how much my roleplay partners write, but I do like their writing to be clean and presentable, with good spelling and punctuation. I play in the first person, usually.</p>
<p>I like to GM games sometimes. I'm fond of sandboxes, and I spend a lot of my time I should be working making them (don't tell my boss). One of these days, I'll write a guide on how to play a GM-and-player RP, because not everyone gets it!</p>
<p>I do <a href="erp.html">ERP</a> sometimes. Don't look at me like that! I have needs too, m'kay? I tend to be pretty vanilla, <a href="bdsm.html">and I'm not into BDSM.</a> If you found me somewhere decidedly not-vanilla, <i>keep it secret, keep it safe.</i></p>
