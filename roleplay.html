<h1>Roleplaying!</h1>
<p>Let's be real, this is why you're here. Let's talk scenarios.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Raiders!</b>
  <p>The year is 1936. We're treasure hunters hot on the tail of an ancient artifact. Tomb raiding, shootouts, and daring escapades!</p></li>
  <li><b>Ad Sidera</b>
  <p>Humanity has taken to the stars with the invention of the spike drive, a metadimensional FTL system freeing us from the confines of our planet.</p>
  <p>We're colonists on one of the first interstellar voyages, our mission to establish a new foothold in the universe.</p></li>
  <li><b>Pig at a Wedding</b>
  <p>Alice and Bob are getting married. Ugh.</p>
  <p>They invited us, too. Ugh. They're just the <i>worst.</i></p>
  <p>We meet before the wedding, and discover out mutual hatred of the bride and groom. Over drinks far too late in the evening, while we commiserate, we hatch a plan. The perfect revenge.</p>
  <p>We're going to sneak a huge fucking pig into the wedding, and set it loose at the perfect time.</p>
  <p>It's going to take discipline. Guts. Ingenuity. But by God, it will be <i>so</i> worth it.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
