<h1>Sophie's "Dungeon Crawl" SRD</h1>
<p>I have strong opinions about how D&D should be played. Rather than talk your ear off, these are my house rules for 0e. Why 0e? Because it <i>begs</i> to be house-ruled, and is the easiest edition to homebrew from.</p>
<h2>Stats</h2>
<p>Roll 3d6 and assign the results in order to Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma.</p>
<table>
<tr>
  <th>Stat</th>

<p><b>STR:</b> Apply to melee to-hit<br><b>DEX:</b> Apply to ranged to-hit<br><b>CON:</b> Apply to each HD when rolling HP<br><b>INT:</b> Additional spell if caster<br><b>WIS:</b> Apply to saving throws<br><b>CHA:</b> Apply to reaction rolls and morale</p>
<h2>Classes</h2>
<p>The three classes are Fighter, Magic-User, and Thief. Pick one.</p>

<h3>Fighter</h3>

<p>Fighters add their level to rolls to hit, and half their level to damage rolls. If they roll a 20 or higher to hit, they instantly slay their target. Fighters have advantage on saves against physical harm.</p>

<h3>Magic-User</h3>
<table>

  <th>40,000</th>
  <th>6d6-6</th>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Magic-Users may memorize two known spells per level every day, and cast one memorized spell per level every day. They may use magic-items, and create magic items, provided the necessary resources. Magic-Users have advantage on saves against spells. Magic-Users cannot both wear armor and cast spells.</p>

<h3>Thief</h3>

<tr>
  <th>Level</th>
  <th>Exp.</th>

<tr>
  <th>1</th>

  <th>6d6</th>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Thieves add half their level to rolls to-hit. If unencumbered and unobserved, a Thief may slip into the shadows and remain virtually invisible, as long as they are motionless. Thieves hit automatically when attacking from surprise, and do their HD in damage. With the proper tools, a thief can open most locks, even magical ones, in the space of a turn on a roll of 1-4 on a d6. For non-magical locks, they may make multiple attempts.</p>
