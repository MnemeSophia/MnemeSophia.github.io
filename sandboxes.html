<h1>Sandboxes and Story Arcs</h1>
<p>I mostly run sandboxes. Sandbox gaming is relatively less popular than the more prevalent “story arc” style of play, but it has a long and splendid tradition of fun behind it.</p>
<p>A sandbox campaign is built with no presumption of an overarching plot or direction. The PCs are not particularly chosen by destiny, and their fates are wholly undirected by narrative fiat. Each PC has their own goals, motivations, and hopes, and it is the GM’s job to provide them with interesting situations and engaging adventures in which they might strive to carry out their plans. Some will succeed, and others will perish hideously, perhaps of no greater crime than sufficiently bad luck. The campaign world shifts and reacts to PC actions, and the overall goal of the party might change from one session to the next.</p>
<p>Story arc campaigns are built around a particular plot line or narrative thread. The campaign is about how the heroes deal with that plot and the actions they take in response to the inevitable events and situations that the narrative thrusts upon them. It’s tacitly assumed that all the PCs are going to get involved in the plot and cooperate with it to at least a basic level; they won’t simply decide to wash their hands of the affair and go hunt monsters two nations away.</p>
<p>Both styles of adventuring are perfectly valid and provide their own pleasures. A good story arc can hit narrative beats and emphasize coherent themes that would
be impossible to ensure in a sandbox campaign, while a sandbox campaign allows for a refreshing amount of surprise for both players and GMs, as neither of them
can be entirely sure what’s going to happen in the next session. This surprise helps keep things fresh for the GM.</p>
