<h1>Submissive Writing: When Your Character Gets Completely Dominated</h1>
<p><i>This text is taken from the original post by NemisNemesis on r/NSFW_GMing.</i></p>
<p>A lot of players I've seen wanting to play submissive characters have trouble actually writing stuff when their character cannot initiate actions. They have trouble moving the scene forward, repeat things they've already said just to fill space, or repeat things their Dom said but from their perspective ("He does this" -> "She gets this done to her"). </p>
<p>As I'm currently engaged in a scene where my character is entirely submitting herself to an NPC, I thought I'd post an excerpt here and explain how I personally write from a submissive standpoint, both as GM and as player. My GM appears to be very good playing a dominant NPC, so of course I got lucky, but I still hope that this is a good example to put out there. A good Dom is of course vital to good domination, but a good Sub is, too. I'd say the more experienced the RPers, the more power can be transferred to one side (and sadly, bad Doms like too much power all too much). </p>
<h3>General Literacy</h3>
<p> I have to preface what good writing is because it applies very much to this scenario in a specific way. Oftentimes I see posts demanding X amounts of lines as a baseline for literacy, and while that can be a decent, easy-to-digest measurement for how well someone writes, it's a bit of a trap. Even a 10-word reply or less can have more impact than 10 lines ("No," she snarls, to the sound of glass crushing). Given with a bit of setup like a drink in her hand and depending on what she's replying to, you can tell she's getting angry, or something has struck a nerve, something for others to read her reaction with and bounce off of. </p>
<p>Doms will naturally lean more towards actionable and they're largely responsible for the scene progressing, subs more towards reactive and setting things up for the Dom to push further, but almost always will individual parts you write naturally have a bit of both. Reactive means that you're responding to your RP partner, acknowledging their actions having an effect on your character and the scene. Actionable means you write things that your partner can respond to. The most obvious of this is questions in dialogue, but it can also mean grabbing things, mentioning things for your partner to grab, expressions, poses etc. </p>
<h3>The Excerpt</h3>
<p> This is happening in an inn room with a group of half-orc NPCs, Steph having received a throatpie just before from Drarell, then smearing her face messy with his cock. </p>
<p>GM:
<blockquote>Crugak grabs Stephanie's hair and holds her head firmly as he pulls her away from Drarell entirely, the other half-orc taking a seat to regain his composure. He presses her up against a wall and uses it as a backstop to keep her steady while he thrust in and out of her tingling pussy. He puts one hand on her cheek and presses her face against the wall as he plows her from behind. </blockquote></p>
<p>Me:
<blockquote>Briefly biting her lip when her long, wide, aggressive ponytail gets yanked, Steph spills a bit of semen from the corners of her mouth like a vampire. She hits the wall with an "oof" and closes one eye, the cheek below pushed up and flattened against the wall. The other cheek also gets flattened, but she manages to keep that eye open between the fingers rudely smushing against her face. Her tits spill out from the sides from getting flattened too, visible from the back, rolling with the rocking of her body across the wood. "Fnnnnnck" she manages to get out without spilling any more semen, letting herself be utterly dominated, something she's evidently loving as Crugak can feel from her rapidly re-flushing, clamping-down pussy. Though her arms are free, she again crosses them in the small of her back, just to 'lock them away'. "Fnnnck'ng fnnnnnck!" </blockquote></p>
<h3>Dissection</h3>
<p> Despite having 0 agency in the scene due to being utterly dominated, my part is still bigger than the GM's without repeating anything other than to call back to.</p>
<p><b>Reactive:</b> He pulls her hair, she bites her lip with a bit of semen. He pushes her against the wall, I describe what that does to her face and body. The whole thing comes together, I make my character moan in effort and pleasure.</p>
<p><b>Actionable:</b> She bites her lip from getting her hair pulled, she evidently likes that and he can tease her more with it. Her face smushes but she manages to keep an eye open, he can stare into her eye or be ruder to her face. Her tits spill out from the sides, he can enjoy the sight or flatten them more. Her pussy clamps down, he can react to the extra sensations. She puts her arms on her back, he can grab on to them.</p>
<p>Expressions, noises, posture, limb placement, clothes coming undone, direct 'passive' effect of body parts (e.g. a pussy hugging a cock), they're all things you can usually still write about even if you don't have any agency. Being on the helpless, submissive end of throatfucking makes things more difficult, but there you can do things like eyes, lips, tongue, saliva, fluids leaking further down, posture, clothes coming undone etc. </p>
