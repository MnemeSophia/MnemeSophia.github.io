<h1>I'm not into BDSM</h1>
<p>BDSM stands for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>B/D: Bondage</li>
  <li>D/S: Dominance and Submission</li>
  <li>S/M: Sadism and Masochism</li>
</ul>
<p>People think BDSM is when you wear leather and someone gets tied up, but if you're asking me if I'm "dom or sub," you're asking me about B<u><b>DS</b></u>M.</p>
<p>You won't get an answer to that...</p>
<p>... because I'm not <i>into</i> BDSM.</p>
<p>Make sense?</p>
<p>Dominance and submission are not mandatory parts of sexuality. They're actually a super specific kink, that, and I will say it again for all the readers in the back...</p>
<p>... I am not into.</p>
<p>Have a nice day! :)</p>
