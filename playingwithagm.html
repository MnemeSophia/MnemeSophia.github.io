    <h1>How to Play with a GM</h1>
    <p>I  GM a lot of roleplay online, and have a specific vision of what roleplay between a Player and a GM should look like. As a rule, nobody does it how I want them to unless I teach them, so here's a manual of "How to Play with a GM." </p>
    <p>Before talking about the rules and principles of playing with a GM, I'll give a simplified example. </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>GM: You're in a room. There's a window and a desk with a chair at it. On the desk are a few scattered pages, a jar of ink, and a quill </p>
      <p>Player: Is there anything written on the pages?</p>
      <p>GM: There are several pages that look like drafts of a letter to a certain "Lucille."</p>
      <p>Player: Is the ink wet, or dry?</p>
      <p>GM: One page near the top is still damp.</p>
      <p>Player: I'll collect up those pages, then. What's out of the window?</p>
      <p>GM: Looking out the window, you see the yard.</p>
      <p>Player: Can I jump out the window?</p>
      <p>GM: Looks like you could.</p>
      <p>Player: Then I will.</p>
      <p>GM: You jump out. You're in the yard now...</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Now that you've seen it, let's talk.</p>

    <h2>How to Play with a GM</h2>
    <h3>1) The game is a conversation.</h3>
    <p>There is very little room for even a paragraph-length reply, here. The GM might hit a paragraph or more when the scene or situation changes, but if the player is typing out lengthy, novel-style prose, we're going to mismatch. Far from frowning on one-liners, I encourage them. The game is a conversation, and conversation is a free-flowing, rapid exchange of words.</p>
    <h3>2) The game takes place in our imaginations.</h3>
    <p>This means a few things. First, it reinforces the first point. The gameplay is not in a paragraph. It's in our minds meeting via conversation. Second, in the context of a GM-and-Player conversation, it means that we have to establish a consistent imagined world between the two of us. How do we do that?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>By asking questions.</li>
      <li>By clarifying descriptions.</li>
      <li>By rewinding when we have a "glitch," i.e. a moment where we failed to sync our imaginations.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>3) The GM describes the world. The Player declares intent. The GM resolves actions. Repeat.</h3>
    <p>This is the basic structure of play. The conversation essentially cycles around these three steps over, and over, and over, until we finish playing. Let's break them down.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p><b>The GM describes the world.</b> This is self-explanatory, but important. The GM does not say what your character does. Only the world around them.</p>

    <p><b>The Player declares intent.</b> Intent is not action, per se. The player describes what they want to do, what they intend to do.</p>

    <p><b>The GM resolves actions.</b> Once the player has declared their intent to do something, how that turns out is in the GM's hands. If the Player intends to jump off a building, they don't say whether they survive the fall. The result of Player action is for the GM to determine.</p>

    <p><b>Repeat.</b> When player actions are resolved, the situation updates. The GM fills the Player in on what's changed, and we do the process again.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h2>The Role and Roll of Dice</h2>
    <p>Not every roleplay needs dice. Most don't. I sometimes use dice to maintain neutrality. It's one thing to say your character died when they jumped off a plane without a parachute. That's obvious It's another to say how a battle between your character and an equally matched opponent turns out. If I decide you win, am I making the game too easy? If I decide you lose, am I biased against you? Messy.</p>
    <p>Solution: If I roll an even number, you win. If I roll an odd number, you lose.</p>
    <p>Slightly weaker opponent? They win on a 1-2, you win on a 3, 4, 5, or 6.</p>
    <p>Want to run recklessly across a rickety rope bridge after that rival treasure hunter? On a 1-out-of-6, the bridge collapses. Otherwise, you make it across.</p>
    <p>I don't always use the same dice, or the same system, but the dice and system aren't the point. I'm simply using dice to offload decision-making to a less potentially-biased power.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>This style is not for everyone. If you're a writer using roleplay as a way of stretching your literary muscles, you'll probably not get what you want from this.</p>
    <p>If you find OOC chat with your partners more fun than the actual RP, this is for you.</p>
    <p>If you are looking to play a game that's more realistic than any videogame you've played, this is for you.</p>
    <p>If exploring a living world is as interesting or more than exploring character motives and themes, this is for you.</p>
    <p>If you're not sure about this, I want you to try it. </p>
