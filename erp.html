<h1>ERP Preferences</h1>
<p>I prefer to play with male partners, but I'm not picky. I tend to be pretty vanilla. As a general rule, anything you could do with your girlfriend, you can do with me, and anything you'd have to talk with her about first, talk with me about it first.</p>
<p>That said, I have a few turn-ons worth mentioning:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Being manhandled.</b> I like to be tossed around and moved how and where you want me. It's not quite "rough sex," it's more feeling desired and seeing how I turn you on, if that makes sense.</li>
  <li><b>Pregnancy risk.</b> I like my breeding and impregnation play. Implied is better than explicit.</li>
  <li><b>ENF.</b> Bit of an odd one, maybe the only "kink" on the list. I like the idea of being caught naked or in compromised situations. I don't want to be blackmailed or anything. Actually, this fantasy is best when I'm not even caught, just in danger of being so.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have some hard limits:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Furries. Not my thing.</li>
  <li>Femboys. I like unapologetic masculinity.</li>
  <li>Futas. See above.</li>
  <li>Infidelity. Just don't like plots about cheating.</li>
  <li>Incest. Keep it in your pants, Oedipus.</li>
</ul>
