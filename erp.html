<h1>ERP Preferences</h1>
<p>I prefer to play with male partners, but I'm not picky. I tend to be pretty vanilla. As a general rule, anything you could do with your girlfriend, you can do with me, and anything you'd have to talk with her about first, talk with me about it first.</p>
<p>That said, I have a few turn-ons worth mentioning:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Being manhandled.</b> I like to be tossed around and moved how and where you want me. It's not quite "rough sex," it's more feeling desired and seeing how I turn you on, if that makes sense.</li>
  <li><b>Pregnancy risk.</b> I like my breeding and impregnation play. Implied is better than explicit.</li>
  <li><b>ENF.</b> Bit of an odd one, maybe the only "kink" on the list. I like the idea of being caught naked or in compromised situations. I don't want to be blackmailed or anything. Actually, this fantasy is best when I'm not even caught, just in danger of being so.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have some hard limits:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Furries. Not my thing.</li>
  <li>Femboys. I like unapologetic masculinity.</li>
  <li>Futas. See above.</li>
  <li>Infidelity. Just don't like plots about cheating.</li>
  <li>Incest. Keep it in your pants, Oedipus.</li>
</ul>
<p>I prefer my ERP to be more like erotica than smut, if that makes sense. In ratio terms, something like 10:1 plot:smut. That's pornographic, but not mindless, contextless fucking.</p>
<h2>Scenarios</h2>
<p>A few scenarios I enjoy.
<ul>
<li><b>Slutty Princess</b>
<p>I'm the princess of a small kingdom, and a certified "daddy's little girl" to the king. I'm his pure little angel and heir.</p>
<p>At least, that's what he thinks. In reality, I'm riding cock almost every day, using my position of power to insinuate myself into any bed I want, and nobody can say or do anything about it. While he looks for me a suitable husband and consort, I'm fucking the stableboy and the guard. It's good to be the princess.</p></li>
<li><b>Government Assigned Neko</b>
<p>Every adult male is assigned a neko. It's the law. She's a virgin and highly fertile. How you treat her is up to you. Will you love and care for her like a daughter, or deflower and knock her up?</p></li>
<li><b>Elven Breeding Season</b>
<p>Elves live for centuries, of course, and you might think they were mostly asexual. But once in an elf's life, they go into heat.Dealing with an elf in heat is... difficult. The only real solution is to fuck their brains out.</p></li>
<li><b>Powerbottom Samus</b>
<p>I'm looking to play as an extremely powerbottom Samus. Basically the most predatory submissive you've ever encountered. She knows what she wants. She wants to be dominated, pinned down, her body explored greedily, and to be fucked like a mewling little submissive.</p>
</li>
<li><b>Rainy Post-Date</b>
<p>We just wrapped up an evening date, but the weather is so bad, neither of us want me to drive home. So you agree to let me stay at your place, at least until the weather blows over.</p></li>
</ul>
