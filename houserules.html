<p>I have opinions about how to play D&D. Rather than talk your ear off, these are my house rules, based mostly on the very first edition from 1974 (which is not "first edition").
<h1>>How to Play</h1>
<p>You will need dice, paper, pencils, and at least two players. One player is the Referee. The Referee prepares a world and adventures before play. The other players create characters who live and act in the world.</p> 
<p>The Referee describes a situation to the players, who then ask questions until the situation is clear in their minds, and propose the actions their characters take. The Referee calls the outcome of these actions, always remaining neutral in her calls.</p>
<p>When the Referee cannot call with true neutrality the results of player actions, she consults the dice. Deciding based on context and character the chance-in-six of a given outcome, she throws a six-sided die, and the result determines the outcome of the actions in question.</p>
<p>When actions have been called, the Referee then describes the new scenario, and the process begins from the top.</p>
<p>This procedure forms the core of gameplay. There will, however, inevitably arise situations that would seem to call for more complexity. What follows is nothing more than a collection of suggested answers to the questions that may arise during play. Hold them lightly.</p>
